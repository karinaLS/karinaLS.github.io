    <b>Karina Lopez Sitja</b> creates her work from pure intuition, letting form and movement flow through her hands. 
    This is the reason why she prefers a direct contact with the elements such as clay, porcelain and fine 
    materials to produce unique pieces. This creative impulse reflects her own way of life, where Buddhism and 
    searching for the voice of the Heart are always present. Wabi Sabi, philosophy of Japanese aesthetics that 
    recognizes Beauty in imperfection and honors the passing of time, also places a special emphasis on her 
    white and polished pieces and rusted bases.

    Karina Lopez Sitja's fluency and spontaneous movement of the small and subtle details in her works, 
    depict her intention to share her inner perception of the world around her and her life. Every piece 
    of work and its creative process represent this precise moment when feelings and form 
    reach a state of harmony.
